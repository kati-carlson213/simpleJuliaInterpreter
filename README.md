NOTE: This was based off a project I had created for a programming languages class. We were tasked with creating an interpreter (complete with a lexer and parser as well)
for a simplified version of the Julia programming language. We were given the grammar (which I put as image files in this project directory) and told to follow it.
The grammar only allows for integers as variables, and allows only very basic parts of a program (print statements, if/then statements, while loops, etc). 

I put my original code in one folder, as originally, I did not make a GUI for this program. I had just ran my original code by using the terminal to test it. However,
I added an user interface later on (after I turned in my original project).
